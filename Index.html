        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>There are a number of reasons why the rising sea levels is a cause for concern,In the United States, almost 30 percent of the population lives in coastal areas, where sea level rise plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms. Globally, 8 of the world’s 10 largest cities are near a coast, according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans.Higher background water levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges, such as those associated with Hurricane Katrina, “Superstorm” Sandy, and Hurricane Michael, push farther inland than they once did. Higher sea level also means more frequent high-tide flooding,which in turn has the possibility of causing more damages and deaths to occur</p>

          Landloss and Coastal erosion
         
        </h3>
        <p>For those living on and near a coastal region are put at a higher risk compared to others.While many areas will be impacted by higher storm surges and daytime flooding, some areas of land will be permanently submerged or degraded by water. Research from Climate Central estimates that by 2050, 4.4 million acres of individual properties in the United States are projected to be at least partly below tide lines. For island communities that rise only a few meters above the water, sea level rise is an existential threat. The loss is more than terrestrial and economic but cultural as well. With Ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet increasing seven-fold from 34 billion tons per year between 1992-2001 to 247 billion tons per year between 2012 and 2016.
          As well as Antarctic ice loss nearly quadrupling from 51 billion tons per year between 1992 and 2001 to 199 billion tons per year from 2012-2016 we might see some coastal communities dissapear alot faster then anticipated.

          <h2>What's causing sea levels to rise?</h2>
          <p>
            Global warming is causing global mean sea level to rise in two ways. First, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are melting and adding water to the ocean. Second, the volume of the ocean is expanding as the water warms. A third, much smaller contributor to sea level rise is a decline in the amount of liquid water on land—aquifers, lakes and reservoirs, rivers, soil moisture. This shift of liquid water from land to ocean is largely due to people depleting ground water.From the 1970s up through the last decade or so, melting and heat expansion were contributing roughly equally to observed sea level rise. But the melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets has accelerated:

          <h3>At what rate are our sea level rising?</h3>
          <p>
            Ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet increased seven-fold from 34 billion tons per year between 1992-2001 to 247 billion tons per year between 2012 and 2016.
Antarctic ice loss nearly quadrupled from 51 billion tons per year between 1992 and 2001 to 199 billion tons per year from 2012-2016.

          <h4>Impact on wildlife</h4>
          <p>Just as rising seas pose serious threats to coastal residents and human-built systems and structures, and cause human climate refugees to flee low-lying atolls, these seas are also threatening many diverse species of wildlife.Sea level rise is threatening the survival of many species and contrarily to one might think, these are not just terrestrial creatures. Seemingly diverse animals as the Florida Key deer, loggerhead sea turtle and Hawaiian monk seal, are all at risk. They all share the potential for loss of critical habitat, a fact that may surprise some as the latter two are classified as marine animals that live the majority of their lives in the ocean. </p>
          <h4>Wildlife impact on humans</h4>
          <p>As a result this is causing the pushing of these animals closer to human civilization in search of food that has drastically been reduced as a result of rising sea levels.</p>
